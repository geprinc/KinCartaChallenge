### KIN + KARTA Challenge from Guido Princ


To run project you can use common command like:

For iOS:

`react-native run-ios`

For Android:

`react-native run-android`

TODOs i would like to add

- Tests

- Better Interfaces and components management

- Changed Details map to a FlatList (i didn't do it because i had a Typescript error and didn't want to waste time)

- We use Redux Recompose to reduce redux lines of common code.

- I could avoid repeating many styles if i extract them into a general common style between screens.


I changed assets name because i had an import issue with them.
