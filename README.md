### KIN + KARTA Challenge from Guido Princ

For both cases you must have a terminal running the packager using:

`yarn run packager`

Then to run for each device:

- iOS:

First install pods using:

`yarn run pods`

then run project using

`yarn run ios`

- Android:

Just run the project using

`yarn run android`



# TODOs I would like to add

- Tests

- Better Interfaces and components management

- Changed Details map to a FlatList (i didn't do it because i had a Typescript error and didn't want to waste time)

- I could avoid repeating many styles if i extract them into a general common style between screens.


I changed assets name because i had an import issue with them.
